        <i><b>Mask Still Life III</b></i> depicts five masks with various grotesque expressions. Although the painting is classified as a still life,
        it is anything but still. Masks, with their ability to convey a range of emotions, held a unique place in Europe, particularly in the north
        and were readily available for sale. 
        This work takes these motifs and pushes them farther - there is no human figure in his masks to ground the piece in the familiar or with whom viewers can identify.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Nolde's brushstrokes in this piece are as expressive as the masks; they have a wild, ominous urgency to them. The dark, greenish blue background provides
        a strong contrast to the rich yellow, red, and orange colors of the masks. With their frozen yet clearly conveyed emotion, masks as subject matter encapsulate
        the driving force behind German Expressionism.
