        <i><b>Stormy Sea</b></i> is a landscape painting done with watercolor. This piece has very organic lines and there are many spots of bright colors,
        in particular blues and oranges. There are two boats on the horizon and a steam boat off to the right side which is a nod to modernism and industrialization.

        The bright fiery orange on the horizon gives a sense of drama to the piece and the white color in the foreground shows the crests of the moving waves.
        The waves juxtaposed against the fiery horizon animate the painting, and the colors help to depict the tumultuous waves. The orange light in the sky imbues
        energy and excitement against the dark blue waters.
