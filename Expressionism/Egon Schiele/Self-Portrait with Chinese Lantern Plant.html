        The 1912 <i><b>Self-Portrait with Chinese Lantern Plant</b></i> is now one of Egon Schiele's most famous works, one that shows the
        artist at the height of his artistic prowess. A balanced composition with nothing left to chance, each line has found its continuation
        or a corresponding counterpart: hair and body mirror each other, trimmed at the horizontal edges of the image, with these dark sections
        balanced by the bright red-colored lantern fruits.

        In a further show of balance, Schiele's head is turned to the right, with his gaze
        fixed directly toward the observer. The image's composition is particularly defined by sharp lines and a virtuoso application of color.
        In this way, the artist presents himself as both fragile and confident at the same time. The work was conceived as a counterpart to his
        portrait of Wally Neuzil made at the same time, which explains the distinctively asymmetric composition.
