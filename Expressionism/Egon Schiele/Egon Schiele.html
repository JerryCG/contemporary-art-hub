    <p>
        <i><b>Egon Schiele</b></i> is an Austrian artist, who is a major figurative painter of the early 20th century. His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality, and the many
        self-portraits the artist produced, including nude self-portraits. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist
        as an early exponent of Expressionism.

        Schiele often used color sparingly, his work identifiable instead by his characteristic sinuous black line. In his many self-portraits, Schiele is typically nude and staring directly
        towards the viewer, making the works both revealing and confrontational. Schieleâ€™s female subjects are often nude as well, their bodies portrayed in various contorted positions.
