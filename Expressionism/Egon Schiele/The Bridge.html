        Exploring Gyor in his spare time, he came upon the subject of <i><b>The Bridge</b></i>. Schiele was delighted with the structure's unusual architecture,
        which he called "quite Asiatic, Chinese-like". The painting was begun in the early weeks of 1913 and finished by winter's end. Like other paintings
        done at this time, when Schiele was especially low on funds, <i><b>The Bridge</b></i> was executed on two pieced-together lengths of canvas.
