        In any European Museum of classical or contemporary art you are in, there is bound to be Nude, many of the female body,
        a bit less male. But only the paintings of Egon Schiele after a few minutes of study will cause a strange awkwardness and panic,
        the desire to turn away. And it's not in the spice of the depicted scenes - and that the artist depicts something more than nudity,
        he bares the souls of his heroes. In <i><b>The Embrace</b></i>, there is one tone in the depiction of sexual passion and desire that you just will not find from the
        awl, he is never playful and giggling. His lust, desperate and painful, is sacred and salutary.
        "I paint the light that pours from all the bodies"- said Schiele.
