        Finished in 1899, the <i><b>The Dance of Life</b></i> by Edvard Munch is merely a representation of one of his internal conflicts.
        Hating the concept of marriage, Munch uses three female figures to describe 3 stages of life. The woman in white symbolizes purity,
        youth and virginity. In the opposite side, the woman dressed in black is a visual representation of death and loneliness.
        The center showcases a man dancing with a woman in red, the color of emotion, drama and blood. She is the perfect representation
        of a temptress fallen in love with the man besides her. The close proximity between the women represents the shortness of life
        and the transition from one stage to another.
