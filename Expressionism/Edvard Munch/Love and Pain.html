        In <i><b>Love and Pain</b></i>, we see a man in anguish, arms around his love, while she tries to comfort him.
        Perhaps she is laying her face on his shoulder even. Some thought it was about his visits to prostitutes,
        yet others saw it as some sort of macabre fantasy about the death of his favorite sister. Evidently Munch
        remained ambiguous about the deeper meaning behind it.

        It was considered shocking when it was unveiled, somehow people saw sado-masochism in it.Maybe it's her loose
        red hair and red dress that mark her as a siren. The darkness surrounding them, and the man's own black clothing
        make her stand out all the more. But is it really shocking today?
