        Munch's <i><b>Evening on Karl Johan Street</b></i> is a scene from a nightmare, an anxiety dream worked up into a painting.
        Black coated figures with corpse-white faces like Roswell aliens stream zombie-like and unstoppable towards the viewer.
        Munch painted this vision of Karl Johan Street, the main street of Kristiania (now Oslo), in 1892;
        he'd previously painted relatively realistic pictures of the street, but here it becomes the scene for an Expressionist vision of angst.

        He eradicates detail; the lighted windows seem to float in space like huge rectangular kites, and the faces are featureless except
        for their staring eyes (and in one case a massive black bar of moustache). What in real life was a pre-theatre or after-dinner
        stroll has been filtered through an anguished sensibility to become a horrific zombie movie. The strong diagonal composition,
        with the house fronts on the left hand side of the picture crowding the evening strollers into the foreground, creates a feeling
        of claustrophobia.

        One dark, slight figure walks away. This is often interpreted as Munch himself, turning away from a crowd whose noise and bustle is
        too much for the sensitive soul of an artist. He is doubled by the huge dark mass of a single tree looming on the right. Munch has
        created a powerful portrayal of loneliness and fear.
