        <i><b>Expressionism</b></i> a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.
        Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.

    <p class="margin">
        Expressionism, artistic style in which the artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses
        that objects and events arouse within a person. The artist accomplishes this aim through distortion, exaggeration, primitivism, and
        fantasy and through the vivid, jarring, violent, or dynamic application of formal elements. In a broader sense Expressionism is one
        of the main currents of art in the later 19th and the 20th centuries, and its qualities of highly subjective, personal, spontaneous
        self-expression are typical of a wide range of modern artists and art movements. Expressionism can also be seen as a permanent
        tendency in Germanic and Nordic art from at least the European Middle Ages, particularly in times of social change or spiritual crisis,
        and in this sense it forms the converse of the rationalist and classicizing tendencies of Italy and later of France.
