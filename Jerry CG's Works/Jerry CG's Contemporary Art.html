    <h2>a. Xerox Art</h2>
    <p>Xerox Art is the art of "Copy of Copy". By the method of "Degeneration",
    we can get pictures of different texture qualities. </p>
    <p>In my work, first I took a picture of my hometown's beautiful watery scene with floating
    boats and ancient town. Then I made a black-and-white copy of the original photo.
    And I continued to make 8 copies sequentially. You could see when pictures are
    continuously copied, great amount of details will be lost and this will create
    special visual arts. Enjoy it!</p>

    <h2>b. Sound Map</h2>
    <p>Sound map is a kind of art that can visualize the sounds. We use different
    dots, lines, curves ans shapes to depict the volume, pitch, indensity of sounds. In
    my work, I recorded the sounds when I went from Festival Walk to Olympia City. Detailed
    explanations are shown in the sound map. Enjoy it!
