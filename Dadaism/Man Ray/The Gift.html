        This piece, <i><b>The Gift</b></i> was made in the afternoon on the opening day of Man Ray's first solo show in Paris.
        It was intended as a gift to the gallery owner, the poet Philippe Soupault, and Ray added it to the show at the last minute.
        But the object received much attention and disappeared at the end of the opening. Another assisted readymade,
        Ray took a simple utilitarian object, an iron, and made it evoke different qualities by attaching the tacks.
        Hence the tacks, which cling and hold, contrast with the iron, which is meant to smoothly glide, and both are rendered useless.
