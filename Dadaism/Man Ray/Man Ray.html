        <i><b>Man Ray</b></i> was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada movement, although his ties were informal.  He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer.
        Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called "rayographs" in reference to himself.
