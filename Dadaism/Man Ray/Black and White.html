        This photograph, <i><b>Black and White</b></i>, depicts Kiki de Montparnasse's head next to an African ceremonial mask. It bears a title that references both the black and white process of photography as well as skin color.
        It was created at a time when African art and culture was much in vogue. The oval faces of the two almost look identical in their serene expressions, but he contrasts her soft pale face with the shiny black mask.
        He simplifies the conflict of society into a problem of lighting and imagery in aesthetics - one oval next to another oval; one laying on its side contrasted with another that is erect; one lit from above and the other from the side.
