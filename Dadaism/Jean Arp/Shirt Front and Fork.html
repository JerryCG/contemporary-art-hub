        One of a series of wooden relief sculptures made by Arp in the 1920s, <i><b>Shirt Front and Fork</b></i> depicts a recognizable form in an unrecognizable context.
        Rendered in black, grey and white, the work has an overt graphic quality that allows the viewer to quickly identify the shape of a fork on the right side.
        The object to the left, which resembles an enlarged tooth, is less easy to identify, and remains mysterious, evoking a host of associations that are ultimately
        unresolved for the viewer.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Completed only a few years after Arp joined the Zurich Dada group and shortly before he participated in landmark Surrealist exhibitions,
        this work marks the transition from one movement to another. It is rooted in a stream of unconsciousness that foreshadows the core ambition of the Surrealists to
        resolve the contradictions between dream and reality. Throughout his career, Arp favored a restricted palette and, as he put it in 1955, "especially...black, white and grey"
        because, he explained, "There is a certain need in me for communication with human beings. Black and white is writing."
