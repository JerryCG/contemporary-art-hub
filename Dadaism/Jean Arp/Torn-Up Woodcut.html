        Arp felt that he could incorporate chance within artistic production, comparing the role of the artist to a plant bearing fruit.
        According to the Laws of Chance shows Arp playing with random composition, in this case dropping painted pieces of paper onto a surface.
        <i><b>Torn Woodcut</b></i> was made in a similar way in 1954, using the pieces of a Dada print he had made in 1920.
