    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <i><b>Jean Arp</b></i> was a French-German artist and poet known as a founding member of Dadaism. His abstract collages, paintings, and sculptures of organic forms were motivated by
        an interest in harnessing unconscious thought and parodying established ideas. "A painting or sculpture not modeled on any real object is every bit as concrete and sensuous as a leaf or a stone,"
        he once remarked. "But it is an incomplete art which privileges the intellect to the detriment of the senses."
