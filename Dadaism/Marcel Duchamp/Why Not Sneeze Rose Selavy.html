        <i><b>Why not Sneeze, Rose Selavy?</b></i> is a 1921 "readymade" sculpture by Marcel Duchamp. Specifically, Duchamp considered this to be an "assisted Readymade", this being because the original object has been altered by the artist.
        The meaning of this is that the birdcage has been "assisted" by the addition of the other objects. They consist of 152 white cubes (made of marble, but resembling sugar cubes), a mercury thermometer, a piece of cuttlebone, and a tiny porcelain dish.
        The birdcage is made of painted metal and contains several wooden perches.

        About the sculpture, Duchamp said: "It is a Readymade in which the sugar is changed to marble. It is sort of a mythological effect."
        An explanation for the piece given by Duchamp involves the coldness of the marble cubes, the "heat-giving" properties of the sugar cubes,
        the thermometer evaluating temperature, and the sneezing that can result from cold. In commenting on the title Duchamp pointed out that there is
        a "dissociation gap" between sneezing at will and sneezing against one's will.
