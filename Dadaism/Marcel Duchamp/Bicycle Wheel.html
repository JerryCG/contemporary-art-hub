        <i><b>Bicycle Wheel</b></i> by Marcel Duchamp was created in 1913 by mounting a bicycle wheel and fork on a stool painted white.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        He explained for this work, "The Bicycle Wheel is my first Readymade, so much so that at first it wasn't even called a Readymade.
        It still had little to do with the idea of the Readymade. Rather it had more to do with the idea of chance.
        In a way, it was simply letting things go by themselves and having a sort of created atmosphere in a studio,
        an apartment where you live. Probably, to help your ideas come out of your head. To set the wheel turning was very soothing,
        very comforting, a sort of opening of avenues on other things than material life of every day. I liked the idea of having a bicycle wheel in my studio.
        I enjoyed looking at it, just as I enjoyed looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace. It was like having a fireplace in my studio,
        the movement of the wheel reminded me of the movement of flames."
