    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <i><b>Carl Andre</b></i> is an American minimalist artist known for his Minimalist sculptures and installations.
        His experience working blue collar jobs and the aesthetics of industrial design have had a deep impact on his art, and along with Donald Judd,
        Andre helped define the early Minimalist movement. His straightforward arrangements of factory-cut wood, bricks, and other raw materials
        changed the framework of how sculpture is seen and made today.
