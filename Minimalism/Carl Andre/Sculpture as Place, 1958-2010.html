        <i><b>Carl Andre: Sculpture as Place, 1958-2010</b></i>, the retrospective on the artist, reviews his fifty years of artistic production, in the course of which he created over two
        thousand sculptures and an equal number of poems, plus dozens of assemblages, and hundreds of postcards. The exhibition represents all major historical and aesthetic shifts in Andre's career,
        from his early exercises to his most recent work. The main stages of Andre's mature oeuvre are represented by a large selection of sculptures including the artist's defining floor sculptures,
        modular arrangements of unaltered building and industrial materials such as brick stacks, metal squares, slabs, and timber blocks.

        Carl Andre is one of the most outstanding and complex figures in Minimal Art. From a reductionist stance, he attempted to explore the
        essence of the object by employing industrial materials and processes that would allow serial reproduction, eliminating every subjective trace so
        that the artwork would refer exclusively to itself.

        The beginnings of this artist, who radically redefined the field of sculpture, were marked by his friendships with the filmmaker Hollis Frampton and the painterFrank Stella,
        and by his early discovery of the sculpture of Constantin Brancusi and thepoetics of Ezra Pound. With unaltered industrial materials and an irreverent approach to language,
        he proposed a revolutionary concept of composition involving the use of minimal units and a particular exploration of space. Traceable in his career are some of the most
        influential of the trends that followed the path of minimalism, from visual poetry to Land Art or conceptual art.

        Upon arriving in New York City in 1957, after an erratic artistic education lasting several years, Carl Andre found himself able to develop his creativity in sculpture,
        drawing and experimental writing. The abundant tabletop geometric constructions of his first period were made primarily from wood, but he soon identified the limitations
        of his own craftsmanship and became intrigued by the inherent properties of manufactured materials - their form, weight, and surface. In a span of six years, from 1958 through 1964,
        Andre would vacate the residues of the artist's hand from his sculptures, which before this time he had made by chiseling and cutting with power tools to render slender pillars from single
        planks or stacks that rise from the ground to his own height. He even radicalized his gesture of imbuing sculpture with horizontality to the point of laying it flat on the ground.
        At the same time, accompanied by his avid intellect, a deep affection for poetry, and commitment to leftist politics, Andre would sharpen his questions and clarify his understanding
        of sculpture by making the typewriter his studio.

        In the 1960s, he generated over thirteen hundred pages of poems, in a monumental reflection that called attention to the subtle intertwining of materials and the English language.
        In his own words: "Art is not only the investment of creative energy, but the sharpening of the critical faculties. . . . I think art is truly an open set. There are no ideal forms to strive for nor hierarchies to obtain to.
        Things have qualities. Perceive the qualities."

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        At the outset of Andre's explorations with both writing and sculpting, the question became not whether scavenging from the streets for materials or extracting words from a book enacted a new and copious stance for originality,
        or whether the anonymity of the machine-made units or the typewritten text accounted for the juncture of instrument and instinct. It was rather that through thinking about the materiality of sculpting and writing, the form of language and matter,
        the artist operates within a historical development, providentially decodes and proposes a reading of present conditions, and ultimately shifts art into a realm of experience. The discovery of this examination proved to be a defining event in Andre's
        unorthodox probing with sculpture and poetry and led him to devise a notion of "place" that is charged with utopian energy and an invigorating understanding of art as a viewpoint into reality. It is the conjunction of these two modes of creation,
        the placement of materials and words, that is the root of Andre's reciprocal relationship to place, where we may recognize our presence and "perceive the qualities."
