        Donald Judd's <i><b>progression sculptures</b></i> are a series of wall sculptures created between 1964 and the 1970s.
        Each work is similar in form, with Judd's choice of material varying depending on the date of production.
        Judd based each work on a simple mathematical sequence such as the Fibonacci Sequence.
        He typically called the works Untitled, sometimes adding the word progression to the title.
        Judd was interested in the minimalist notion of seriality or serial progression rather than the more classical relational method of composition.
