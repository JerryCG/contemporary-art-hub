        In the 1970s, minimalist artist Donald Judd moved to Marfa, Texas, where he created giant works of art that bask beneath
        vast desert skies. In the years since, Marfa has emerged as a hot spot for art tourism. </b>

        This tiny town perched on the high plains of the Chihuahua desert is nothing less than an arts world station of the cross,
        like Art Basel in Miami, or Documenta in Germany. It's a blue-chip arts destination for the sort of glamorous scenesters who visit
        Amsterdam for the Rijksmuseum and the drugs. "They speak about Marfa with the same kind of reverent tones generally reserved for the pilgrimage of the Virgin of Lourdes,"
        notes Carolina Miranda, a writer who covers the art world.

        It all started when the acclaimed minimalist artist Donald Judd left New York City in the 1970s for this dusty dot of a town. He wanted to escape the art scene he claimed to disdain.
        With the help of the DIA Foundation, Judd acquired an entire Army base, and before he died in 1994, he filled it with art, including light installations by Dan Flavin and Judd's own signature boxes.
        One hundred of them, made of silvery milled aluminum, are housed in two old brick artillery sheds. They sit in perfect quiet rows, glowing or seemingly translucent, depending on the light.
