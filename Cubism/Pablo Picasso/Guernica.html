        Probably Picasso's most famous work, <i><b>Guernica</b></i> is certainly the his most powerful political statement,
        painted as an immediate reaction to the Nazi's devastating casual bombing practice on the Basque town of Guernica during Spanish Civil War.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Guernica shows the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon individuals, particularly innocent civilians.
        This work has gained a monumental status, becoming a perpetual reminder of the tragedies of war, an anti-war symbol, and an embodiment
        of peace. On completion Guernica was displayed around the world in a brief tour, becoming famous and widely acclaimed.
        This tour helped bring the Spanish Civil War to the world's attention.

        Interpretations of Guernica vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements:
        the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, "The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture.
        Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the
        specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of
        ways throughout Picasso's career."
