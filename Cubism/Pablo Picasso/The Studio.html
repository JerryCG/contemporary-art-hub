        From 1927 to 1929 Pablo Picasso elaborated a complex discourse on the activity of the artist through the theme of the studio.
        Among the variations in the series, the closest to the present example is <i><b>The Studio</b></i> of 1928.
        The works share the vivid palette of Synthetic Cubism, limited to draw attention to a conspicuous and authoritative execution in planar areas.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Picasso's The Studio, is such a close parallel to the Johannes Vermeer that it might almost have been painted to demonstrate how the Vermeer
        could be translated into abstract terms. Picasso constructs the figure of the painter in a few dark lines played against the light field of the canvas he
        is about to work on. Vermeer constructs the figure of his painter as a dark silhouette, also played in part against the creamy field of his canvas,
        upon which he has just begun to work. Both painters hold their brushes in a moment's pause. The "brush" in the Picasso is the short diagonal line terminating
        the "arm" that projects horizontally toward the right. Whereas Vermeer's artist has just stayed his hand to glance at the model.
