        <i><b>The City</b></i> demonstrates Leger's interest in depicting the dynamism and dissonance of urban space rather
        than pictorial unity or a static image. His fascination with all things modern beyond conventional high art subject
        matter is evident in the references to traffic lights, billboards, graphic design; he stated that he was especially
        influenced by the place Clichy in Paris with its large posters. Also obvious is a focus on other colors beyond the primary.
        He remarked on his use of color in this period: "Color rushes in like a torrent. It swallows up the walls, the streets ...
        When one opens a window, a piece of shrill publicity blows in the wind ... Exuberance of color and noise."
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In The City, colors play an equal role with form in depicting the chaos of the city; they collide as volumes and flat shapes both recede
        and move forward in space, seeming to overlap like pieces of a collage, giving the viewer the impression of standing on a busy,
        noisy street corner.
