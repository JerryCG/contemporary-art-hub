        <i><b>Three Women</b></i> is an example of Leger's smooth forms, created with machine-like solidity and a precision reminiscent of technology.
        In the tradition of classical images of female nudes, the three women recline in a chic apartment, sipping their drinks.
        The bodies of the women have been simplified into clean forms of smooth shapes, their smooth skin polished like metal.
        After serving in World War I, in which he was badly injured, Leger hoped that technological advances and the machine age
        would cure the chaos unleashed by the war. His quasi-mechanical shapes exemplify his intent to use art as a representation
        of the possibilities of the machine age.
