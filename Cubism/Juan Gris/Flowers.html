        Around this time, Gris and other Cubists began incorporating collage elements, such as newspaper and wallpaper,
        into their paintings. Flowers represents a woman's marble-topped vanity table with a vase of roses, a coffee cup,
        and the morning paper. A tilting oval mirror reflects wallpaper printed with stylized Art Nouveau orchids.
        Newspaper and wallpaper (literal scraps of everyday life) force us to consider the subject through the lens of modernity.
        Gris was particularly fond of rewarding close viewers with hidden messages. Upon close inspection, we glimpse a second
        coffee cup and pipe camouflaged by the table - evidence that the lady is not alone.
