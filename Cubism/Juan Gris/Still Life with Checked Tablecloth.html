        Juan Gris was not only a Cubist master, he was also a genius. <i><b>Still Life with Checked Tablecloth</b></i> features a table brimming with all
        sorts of things: fruit compote, stemmed wine glasses, coffee cups, a bottle of ale, and a guitar. At first glance, it looks like other still life
        paintings from the Cubism era. However, if you look more closely, there is a hidden image: a head of a bull. This shows how skilful Gris is when
        it comes to disguising images. He achieved this by using geometric shapes, playful colours, and stylish textures.
