        <i>Festival of Gods</i> depicts the mysterious sacrificial activities of local people. Gauguin was obsessed with the
        lifestyle of locals. He thinks they are the people who are guided by instinct and get closest to the nature. In this painting,
        Gauguin uses unnatural and subjective colors to present the mysterious and serious scene of the sacrifice ceremony.

        This painting gives the impression of a mysterious dance. The winding lines are simply
        coiled around the entire picture, and the color has crossed the contour line, just like
        countless streams. Blue , purple, yellow, and rose alternate from bottom to top from
        time to time. In practice, it really makes people look like a circle, not a whole.
        This circle relies on the appearance of the idol to obtain a decorative unity.
        There is no doubt that Gauguin's purpose is to create a mysterious effect on this painting,
        although the situation he presents seems to be dramatic.
