    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <i><b>Paul Gauguin</b></i> is a French Post-impressionist artist. Unappreciated until after his death,
        Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist
        style that were distinct from <a href="../../Impressionism/Impressionism.html" target="_blank">Impressionism</a>.
        His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists,
        such as <a href="../../Cubism/Pablo Picasso/Pablo Picasso.html" target="_blank">Pablo Picasso</a> and
        <a href="../../Fauvism/Henri Matisse/Henri Matisse.html" target="_blank">Henri Matisse</a>. 
    </p>
          
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        According to Floyed, childhood experiences sould have great influence on a person's future development.
        Gauguin had a wandering and misery childhood, so he had a special desire to be exiled in his adulthood. He once
        worked as a sailor and afterwards joined the French Navy. But later after his mother's death, he became a stock broker
        in a stock exchange and lived a stable and decent life.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        However, Gauguin was not satisfied with this kind of life. He fell in love with art at this time. Passion towards art
        stimulated his buried desire of being exiled far away. Then he gave up everything in Paris, and went to the isolated Brittany and
        remote Tasia Islands. In this primitive and simple environment, Gauguin looked for the Garden of Eden in art. Most of his excellent artworks were
        born here. Gauguin's art has clear primitive meaning. He thinks art should have a sincere emotion. However, the modern metropolitan civilization is
        losing this kind of emotion. 
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The famous novel <i>"The Moon and Sixpence"</i> was partially based on the life of Paul Gauguin.
