        This painting is related to a scene from the Bible in which Jacob wrestles an angel.
        It depicts this indirectly, through a vision that the women depicted see after a sermon in church.

        The whole painting is full of dreamy colors and godly religious atmosphere. Gauguin gave up the detailed portrayal of figures.
        The female peasants have their back to the viewers or just show half of their faces. The angel and Jacob are also small and vague.
        However, in terms of colors, Gauguin put good effort. The red land, people with black clothes and white hats form a strong contrast, creating
        an obvious decorative effect. Strengthening the effect of colors is the greatest charm of Gauguin's art.
