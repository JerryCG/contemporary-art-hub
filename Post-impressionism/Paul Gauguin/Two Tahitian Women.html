        This painting depicts two topless women, one holding mango blossoms, on the Pacific Island of Tahiti.
        Although Tahiti is depicted as an innocent paradise, the two women in the painting confront the
        viewer in a way similar to that in <a href="../../Impressionism/Edouard Manet/Edouard Manet.html" target="_blank">Manet</a>'s <a href="../../Impressionism/Edouard Manet/The Luncheon on the Grass.html" target="_blank">The Luncheon on the Grass</a> (1863)
        or <a href="../../Impressionism/Edouard Manet/Olympia.html" target="_blank">Olympia</a> (1863),
        and follow an artistic tradition of comparing woman's breasts to flowers or fruit.

        <i>Two Tahitian Women</i> is Gauguin's representative artwork of his <i>Island of Tahiti</i> series.
        Gauguin had a close emotion towards the indigenous people on Tahiti Island. The simple and primitive
        local customs, tropical scenery are his favorarite painting themes. The dark skin and robust body of local
        females touched Gauguin who comes from the modern civilization deeply.
