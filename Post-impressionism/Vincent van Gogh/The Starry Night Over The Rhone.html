        <i>The Starry Night Over the Rhone</i> was painted at a spot on the banks of river which
        was only a minute or two's walk from the The Yellow House on the Place Lamartine which
        Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night
        provided the subject for some of his more famous paintings, including the
        later canvas from Saint-Remy, The Starry Night.

        The challenge of painting at night intrigued Van Gogh. The vantage point he chose for
        "Starry Night Over the Rhone" allowed him to capture the reflections of the gas lighting
        in Arles across the glimmering blue water of the Rhone. In the foreground, two lovers
        stroll by the banks of the river. Here his stars glow with a luminescence, shining
        from the dark, blue and velvety night sky. Dotted along the banks of the Rhone
        houses also radiate a light that reflects in the water and adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the painting.
