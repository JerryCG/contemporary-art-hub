        <i><b>The Night Cafe</b></i> depicts the interior of the cafe, with a half-curtained doorway in the center
        background leading, presumably, to more private quarters. Five customers sit at tables along
        the walls to the left and right, and a waiter in a light coat, to one side of a billiard table
        near the center of the room, stands facing the viewer.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In wildly contrasting, vivid colours, the ceiling is green, the upper walls red, the glowing,
        gas ceiling lamps and floor largely yellow. The paint is applied thickly, with many of the
        lines of the room leading toward the door in the back. The perspective looks somewhat downward
        toward the floor.
