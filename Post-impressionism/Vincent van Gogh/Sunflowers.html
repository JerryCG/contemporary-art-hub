        Some of Vincent van Gogh's most famous works are his <i>Sunflower</i> series.
        He painted a total of twelve of these canvases, although the most commonly
        referred to are the seven he painted while in Arles in 1888 - 1889.
        The other five he had painted previously while in Paris in 1887.
