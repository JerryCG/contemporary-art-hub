    <h1 class="heading1"><u>Vincent van Gogh</u> <sub>(Dutch, 1853-1890, Post-impressionism)</sub></h1>
    <img src="Vincent van Gogh.jpg" alt="Vincent van Gogh" width=300 height=325>
    <p>
         A Dutch Post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential
         figures in the history of Western art. He's famed for the beautiful vitality of
         his works that are characterized by expressive and emotive use of vibrant color
         and playful use of impastoed paint. The traumas of his life, recorded in his letters,
         have tended to dominate and distort modern perceptions of his artwork.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Van Gogh had many famous quotes that spread widely:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>"What is done in love is done well."</i></li>
        <li><i>"Paintings have a life of their own that derives from the painter's soul."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I dream of painting and then I paint my dream."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream."</i></li>
        <li><i>"There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I would rather die of passion than of boredom."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things."</i></li>
        <li><i>"It is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning."</i></li>
        <li><i>"I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it."</i></li>
    
    </ul>

                <p> <i>
                    Starry, starry night <br>
                    Paint your palette blue and grey <br>
                    Look out on a summer's day <br>
                    With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <br>
                    Shadows on the hills <br>
                    Sketch the trees and the daffodils <br>
                    Catch the breeze and the winter chills <br>
                    In colors on the snowy linen land <br><br>
                    Now I understand <br>
                    What you tried to say to me <br>
                    And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                    And how you tried to set them free <br> 
                    They would not listen, they did not know how <br>
                    Perhaps they'll listen now <br><br>
                    Starry, starry night <br>
                    Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <br>
                    Swirling clouds in violet haze <br>
                    Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <br>
                    Colors changing hue <br>
                    Morning fields of amber grain <br>
                    Weathered faces lined in pain <br>
                    Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <br><br>
                    Now I understand <br>
                    What you tried to say to me <br>
                    And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                    And how you tried to set them free <br>
                    They would not listen, they did not know how <br>
                    Perhaps they'll listen now <br><br>
                    For they could not love you <br>
                    But still your love was true <br>
                    And when no hope was left in sight <br>
                    On that starry, starry night <br>
                    You took your life, as lovers often do <br>
                    But I could have told you, Vincent <br>
                    This world was never meant for one <br>
                    As beautiful as you <br><br>
                    Starry, starry night <br>
                    Portraits hung in empty halls <br>
                    Frameless heads on nameless walls <br>
                    With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <br>
                    Like the strangers that you've met <br>
                    The ragged men in the ragged clothes <br>
                    The silver thorn, a bloody rose <br>
                    Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <br><br>
                    Now I think I know <br>
                    What you tried to say to me <br>
                    And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                    And how you tried to set them free <br>
                    They would not listen, they're not listening still <br>
                    Perhaps they never will
