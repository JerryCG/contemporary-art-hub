        <i>Wheatfield with Crows</i> is one of Van Gogh's re-created memories of the north,
        and is believed to be the last work of Van Gogh. In early July of 1890, Van Gogh
        travelled to Paris, alone, to stay with Theo and his wife Jo. Theo was in poor
        health and was having financial problems, which was an enormous worry to Van Gogh
        who was keenly aware of the burden he was on his brother and his family.
        In addition, the baby was ill and Jo too was suffering from exhaustion.
        Van Gogh returned quickly to Auvers but rapidly became severely depressed.
        Writing of this picture shortly before his suicide, Van Gogh conveyed
        something of its tragic mood: "Returning there, I set to work. The brush
        almost fell from my hands...I had no difficulty in expressing sadness and
        extreme solitude".

        This painting remains as Vincent van Gogh's most contentious painting.
        The many interpretations of the work are probably more varied than any
        other in Van Gogh's oeuvre. Some see it as Van Gogh's "suicide note"
        put to canvas, while others delve beyond a superficial overview of
        the subject matter and favour a more positive approach.
        And some more extreme critics cast their vision even further -
        beyond the canvas and the brushstrokes - in order to translate the
        images into an entirely new language of the subliminal.
