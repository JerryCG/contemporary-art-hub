    <p>
        The apples and other fruits placed on the cloth and plates are the main characters in Cezanne's still life art. Every
        object in the painting is generalized as the simplest form of geometry. Thick strokes and the solid structure give
        people a heavy sense of volume. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In order to seek the stability and the internal structure of the objects itself, Cezanne carefullly positioned these
        objects and placed importance on the stable and indivisible constitution relations among objects, making them connect with and supplement each other.
        When you view these paintings, you might feel the whole world stands still, and all the objects slowly merge into a whole. 
    </p>

        Some art critics said, 'If you want to pick a grape from a Classical still life painting, you will
        immediately get it; but if you want to pick an apple from Cezanne's still life painting, you will get
        the apple along with the whole cloth!" This statement vividly reveals the strong indivisibility among objects in Cezanne's
        still life paintings.
