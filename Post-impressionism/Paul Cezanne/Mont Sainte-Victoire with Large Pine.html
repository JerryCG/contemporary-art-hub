        The subject of the painting is the Montagne Sainte-Victoire in Provence in southern France.
        Cezanne spent a lot of time in Aix-en-Provence at the time, and developed a special
        relationship with the landscape. This painting represented the Mont Sainte-Victoire
        seen from Montbriant in Aix-en-Provence.

        Though we can clearly see the mountains, houses, pines, there are still some points that are
        contradictory. For example, the outlines of all the objects are specially strengthened. In this way, those
        objects which should loom away appear clearly in the picture. We cannot find the sense of space and perspective in the
        framework of traditional art here. But if you see along the picture, from nearby to far away a bit and a bit, you can
        still feel the great sense of volume and depth. People called this feature as "Planarized deep space".
