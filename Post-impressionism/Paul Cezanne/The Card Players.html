        The Card Players is actually a series of oil paintings by the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cezanne.
        Painted during Cezanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series.
        The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place.
        Cezanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series.

        One version of The Card Players was sold in 2011 to the Royal Family of Qatar for a price estimated at $250 million.
         This price signified a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until November 2017. The series is considered
         by critics to be a cornerstone of Cezanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period,
         as well as a "prelude" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.
