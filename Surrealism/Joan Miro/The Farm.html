        One of the threads running through Miro's work is his sense of something almost supernatural in the land,
        from which he felt he derived his vital energy in the same way that a tree does through its roots.
        <i><b>The Farm</b></i>, painted on Miro's return from his first trip to Paris, culminated this stage, which immediately
        preceded the decisive influence exerted on his work by Surrealism, beginning in 1924. One of the threads running through
        Miro's work is his sense of something almost supernatural in the land, from which he felt he derived his vital energy
        in the same way that a tree does through its roots.
