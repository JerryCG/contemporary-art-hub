        In <i><b>Catalan Landscape</b></i>, his Catalan peasant alter ego is captured simultaneously in the act of shooting a
        rabbit for his cooking pot and fishing for a sardine for his barbecue. 
    </p>

        Miro explained the detail of the painting in the following terms to one viewer: "The Catalan peasant has become a triangle with an ear,
        eye, pipe, the hairs of a beard and a hand. This is a barretina, the Spanish peasant headdress... And the man's heart, entrails and
        sexual organs. I've shown the Toulouse-Rabat airplane on the left; it used to fly past our house once a week. In the painting I
        showed it by a propellor, a ladder and the French and Catalan flags. You can see the Paris-Barcelona axis again, and the ladder,
        which fascinated me. A sea and one boat in the distance, and in the very foreground, a sardine with tail and whiskers gobbling up a fly.
        A broiler waiting for the rabbit, flames and a pimento on the right..."
