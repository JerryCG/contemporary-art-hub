        The world of the imagination and subconscious, rather than being an end in itself, was for Miro a way of giving shape in
        his paintings to his lived experiences and his memories. <i><b>Harlequin's Carnival</b></i> is seen by art critics as an account of the human subconscious mind.
        It is considered the highest point in Miro's personal surrealist style. Along with <a href="../Salvador Dali/The Persistence of Memory.html" target="_blank">the Persistence of Memory</a> by Salvador Dali, <i><b>Harlequin's Carnival</b></i> has become the most iconic images of Surrealism Movement.
