        The subject of <i><b>The Red Model</b></i> is a pair of dirty boots, covered in dust, changing into a pair of feet at the end.
        The wood in the background, the dirt stones and the feet/boots themselves, are all painted in almost photographic detail.
        This gives the impression that what we are seeing is, disconcertingly, real. Many of his works depict completely different
        images in an unusual situation. For example, his painting "Time Transfixed" shows a train emerging from a fireplace.
        In contrast, "The Red Model" is one of a number of his paintings that displays connecting objects, albeit in an unexpected way.
        Another example of this connection theme is "Elective Affinities," painted in 1933, which depicts a giant egg inside a bird cage.
