        Like many works by Rene Magritte, The False Mirror defies normal insights of the viewer. The use of this particular body part is telling in that it seems to be challenging the viewer to
        question whether what they are seeing corresponds with what they think they know. Magritte surprises us immediately by removing the eyes' pupil from its usual location and positioning it
        in the center of the sky. It is surrounded by what appears to be a normal optic opening, although not necessarily of human flesh. The painting is for the most part symmetrical in both its
        vertical and horizontal lines. There is also symmetry of color with the black pupil drawing your attention.
