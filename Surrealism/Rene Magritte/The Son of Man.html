        Magritte painted <i><b>The Son of Man</b></i> as a self-portrait. The painting consists of a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat
        standing in front of a short wall, beyond which is the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple.
        However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend
        backwards at the elbow.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        About the painting, Magritte said:"At least it hides the face partly. Well, so you have the apparent face, the apple,
        hiding the visible but hidden, the face of the person. It's something that happens constantly. Everything we see hides another thing,
        we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us.
        This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the
        visible that is present."
