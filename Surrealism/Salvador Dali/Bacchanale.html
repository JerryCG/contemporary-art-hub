        <i><b>Bacchanale</b></i> is the first of nine ballets designed by Dali to be produced in New York from 1939 to 1949.
        It was also his first set design for Les Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Dali was staying with Gabrielle Chanel in Roquebrune
        when he met Leonide Massine's ballet company that was to leave Europe just before the war. He was presumably intrigued by
        the idea of working for Les Ballets Russes - as had Joan Miro, Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso and many others before him.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In the program Dali gives an account of his ballet: "The setting represents Mount Venus (the Venusberg near Eisenach),
        the background showing Salvador Dali's birthplace, the Ampurdan plain, in the center of which rises the temple as seen
        in The Marriage of the Virgin by Raphael.
