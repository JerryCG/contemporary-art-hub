        <i><b>The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory</b></i> is an oil on canvas re-creation of the Dali's famous work The Persistence of Memory.
        In this version, the landscape from the original work has been flooded with water. Disintegration depicts what is occurring both above and below the water's surface.
        The landscape of Cadaques is now hovering above the water. The plane and block from the original is now divided into brick-like shapes that float in relation to each other,
        with nothing binding them. These represent the breakdown of matter into atoms, a revelation in the age of quantum mechanics.

        Behind the bricks, the horns receding into the
        distance symbolise atomic missiles, highlighting that despite cosmic order, humanity could bring about its own destruction. The dead olive tree from which the soft watch
        hangs has also begun to break apart. The hands of the watches float above their dials, with several conical objects floating in parallel formations
        encircling the watches. A fourth melting watch has been added. The distorted human visage from the original painting is beginning to morph into another
        of the strange fish floating above it. To Dali, however, the fish was a symbol of life.
