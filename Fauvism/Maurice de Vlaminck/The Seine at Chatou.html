        The scene shown here appears to have been observed from a point on the island facing the village of Chatou,
        with its red-roofed houses, on the mainland. Vlaminck shared a studio on the island with fellow artist Andre Derain in 1900.
        Together, they formed what has been called the "School of Chatou," and their painting styleâ€”characterized by bright colors and
        bold brushstrokes - was a harbinger of Fauvism.

        Combining the primary colors of blue and red with white, Vlaminck applied them directly from the tube in daubs and swirls of pigment,
        employing these conventional hues for the white houses, green leaves, reddish-orange tree trunks, and the blue, red, and white trawler
        in the background.
