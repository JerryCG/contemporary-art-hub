    <p>
        Much of de Vlaminck's work fits the style completely, but this work is a bit different.
        The clouds are black and the air is thick with snow, and the trees bend and twist in the wind.
        The stark, contrasting colors give this painting a lot of power, as does the brushwork.
        The clouds are done in wide swaths that suggest monolithic storm clouds, and the snow is rendered in thin, sharp stripes.
        This is most evident on the road and on the trees to the left.  This gives a very harsh sense to the snow and gives the scene an ominous tone.
