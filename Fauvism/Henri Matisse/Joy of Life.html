        <i><b>Joy of Life</b></i> is a large-scale painting (nearly 6 feet in height, 8 feet in width),
        depicting an Arcadian landscape filled with brilliantly colored forest, meadow, sea, and sky and
        populated by nude figures both at rest and in motion. As with the earlier Fauve canvases, color
        is responsive only to emotional expression and the formal needs of the canvas, not the realities
        of nature. The references are many, but in form and date, this painting is closest to Cezanne's <a href="../../Post-impressionism/Paul Cezanne/The Bathers.html" target="_blank">last great image of bathers</a>.
