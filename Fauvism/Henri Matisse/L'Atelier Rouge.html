        Red is often thought of as the most aggressive color. It has the most punch,
        and that's what Matisse needed here. <i><b>L'Atelier Rouge</b></i> was a part of a series, there is,
        for instance, a Pink Studio too. But that canvas was concerned with different issues.
        Here, the red is an attempt to find a color that is forceful enough to resist the
        illusion of deep space by pushing to the surface. The red is, of course painted onto
        the flat canvas but actually fails to remain there visually. Instead, the red becomes
        the walls and furnishing of the room seen in space. Illusion triumphs - Matisse is thwarted.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This triumph of illusion is due in part to the linear perspective that defines the table,
        chairs, and the walls and floor of the studio. But look! Matisse has constructed some of
        the worst linear perspective ever seen. Receding lines should converge, but look at the
        chair on the lower right. The lines widen as they go back. And look to rear left corner
        of the room. The corner is defined by the edge of the pink canvas but above that painting,
        the line that must define the corner is missing! Matisse is literally dismantling the
        perspective of the room but it makes no difference, we still see the room as an inhabitable
        space. Illusion still triumphs.
