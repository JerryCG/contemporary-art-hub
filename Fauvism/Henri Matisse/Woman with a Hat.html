        <i><b>Woman with a Hat</b></i> depicts Matisse's wife, Amelie. First exhibited at the 1905 Salon d'Automne in Paris,
        it was at the center of the controversy that led to the christening of the first modern art movement
        of the twentieth century - Fauvism. The term fauve ("wild beast"), coined by an art critic,
        became forever associated with the artists who exhibited their brightly colored canvases
        in the central gallery (dubbed the cage centrale) of the Grand Palais.

        The artist's wife, Amelie, posed for this half-length portrait. She is depicted in an elaborate outfit
        with classic attributes of the French bourgeoisie: a gloved arm holding a fan and an elaborate hat
        perched atop her head. Her costume's vibrant hues are purely expressive, however; when asked about
        the hue of the dress Madame Matisse was actually wearing when she posed for the portrait,
        the artist allegedly replied, "Black, of course."
