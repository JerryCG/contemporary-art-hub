        <b><i>The Goldfish</i></b> immediately attract our attention due to their color.
        The bright orange strongly contrasts with the more subtle pinks and greens that surround the
        fish bowl and the blue-green background. Blue and orange, as well as green and red, are
        complementary colors and, when placed next to one another, appear even brighter. This
        technique was used extensively by the Fauves, and is particularly striking in Matisse's
        earlier canvas Le Bonheur de vivre. Although he subsequently softened his palette, the
        bold orange is reminiscent of Matisse's fauvist years, which continued to influence
        his use of color throughout his career.

        The Red goldfish echo with the green plants encircling, which shows the dynamic movement of goldfish freely floating
        in the water. The whole picture is filled with purity, serenity and joy, as if it is a sedative of the mind. This painting represents
        Fauvism on its mature stage, which pursues a manifestation of "balance, simplicity, tranquility".
