        Matisse turned to a motif common in the painting: a room decorated with vases, fruits and flowers.
        Yet, as he wrote in 1908, "the basis of my thinking has not changed, but the very thinking has
        evolved and my means of expression have followed on." The luxuriant raspberry red fabric with
        its energetic twists of blue pattern seems to sink down from the wall, taking over the surface
        of the table and uniting it in a single whole, swallowing up the three-dimensional space of the
        room and masterfully confirming the decorative potential of the canvas surface.
