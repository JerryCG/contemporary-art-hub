        <i><b>Westminster Bridge</b></i> is recognised as one of the finest Fauvist compositions.
        The street and buildings are painted in large flat tones while the changing sky and water are
        treated in small, fragmented touches reminiscent of the Neo-impressionist style. The forms of the
        vehicles are distorted, their silhouettes echoing the curb of the Victoria embankment to give a sensation of speed.
        Glaucous figures of buildings are against the rosy sky. Vermilion branches and cold-colored streets form a strong, unnatural and
        unusual beauty.
