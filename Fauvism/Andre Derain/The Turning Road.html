    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <i><b>The Turning Road</b></i>, with its bold, vibrant colors and simplification of form,
        is one of the first examples of Fauvism and served as a precursor to works by Kandinsky and other Expressionists.
        It is not a pure landscape and instead, includes the depiction of figures. Imagery of figures within
        nature recalls the pastoral and Arcadian themes noted in Symbolist paintings.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The artist no longer uses the style of Divisionism noted in his London landscapes and instead, allows the painted
        sections to bleed, one into the other, thereby creating a sensation of volume and depth right on the flat canvas.
        The simplified description of both landscape elements and the figures themselves, gives them an abstract appearance
        that emphasizes the overall decorative nature of the work.
