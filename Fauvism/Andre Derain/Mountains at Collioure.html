        This painting was made while he was working with Henri Matisse at the fishing port of Collioure, in France.
        The work features long strokes of colours such as bright green, blue, mauve and pink. The entire scene is under a jade and turquoise sky.
        In the painting the colour is less emotional than their past works and less imperative. According to Mattise, "Fauve art isn't everything, but it is the foundation of everything."

        The trees and grass were painted with long strokes of colour. The colour which was used is known to have been less emotional than the colour which Van Gogh used.
        Mattise had joined Derain to paint landscapes at the fishing port of Collioure, at the bottom of the Pyrenees. The artists worked together producing artwork.
        The field in the foreground, the trees and the foothills are created in large strokes of bright green, blue, mauve and pink; which suggest a highly "charged"
        encounter with the natural world. The mountains are conceived as flat areas of colour. The whole scene is under a sky of jade and turquoise.
