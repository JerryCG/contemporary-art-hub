        Of the Rodchenko's hugely varied output, perhaps no work is more delicately poised between the shifting social and cultural forces that determined the artist's philosophy than his 1919 masterpiece, <i><b>Construction No.95</b></i>.
        Construction No.95 is part of a series of works Rodchenko built around a single geometric concept - the line - central to Constructivism, and with it, much of contemporary graphic design.
