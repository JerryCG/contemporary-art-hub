    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <i><b>Alexander Rodchenko</b></i> was a founding member of Russian Constructivism - the avant-garde movement characterized by unembellished abstraction.
        He was known for his politically motivated photography, posters, paintings, and sculpture. He wrote: "One has to take several different shots of a subject,
        from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again."
