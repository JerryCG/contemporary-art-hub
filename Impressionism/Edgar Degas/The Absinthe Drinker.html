        The work portrays a woman and man sitting side-by-side, drinking a glass of absinthe.
        They appear lethargic and lonely. The man, wearing a hat, looks to the right off the edge
        of the canvas, while the woman, dressed more formally in fashionable dress and hat,
        stares vacantly downward. A glass filled with absinthe is on the table in front of her.

        The Ballet dancer is an ordinary woman who lost her young and beautiful apprearance. The man
        besides is actually one of Degas's poet friends. They sit in the corner of the bar, a glass of
        bitter absinthe placed on the table, which is filled with depression of the two frustrated people.
