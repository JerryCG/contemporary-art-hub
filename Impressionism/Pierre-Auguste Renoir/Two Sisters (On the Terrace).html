    <p>Renoir worked on the painting on the terrace of the Maison
    Fournaise, a restaurant located on an island in the Seine in
    Chatou, the western suburb of Paris. The painting depicts a
    young woman and her younger sister seated outdoors with a small
    basket containing balls of wool. Over the railings of the terrace
    one can see shrubbery and foliage with the River Seine behind it.

        "He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling
        in life," an anonymous interviewer once wrote about Pierre-Auguste Renoir.
        This may explain why Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is one of the most popular
        paintings in the Art Institute.

        Here Renoir depicted the radiance of
        lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day.
        The older girl, wearing the female boater's blue flannel,
        is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop
        of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of
        the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger
        companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have
        just dashed into the picture.
