        The painting depicts a young couple in a box at the Paris theatre.
        The woman was modelled by Nini Lopez, Renoir's new model who
        would feature in fourteen of his paintings over the next few
        years. The man was his brother Edmond, a journalist and art critic.
        Going to the theatre was as much about being seen as watching
        the performance and whilst the woman is making her presence
        obvious, her companion is scanning the audience through
        his opera-glasses.

        <i>The Theatre Box</i> is the work that made Renoir famous.
        The color method of black and white makes us naturally recall the art style
        of <a href="../Edouard Manet/Edouard Manet.html" target="_blank">Edouard Manet</a>.
        The thick black lines depict the rich posture of the women, which
        forms a strong color contrast with her white and soft skin. This painting
        lays the foundation of Renoir's beautiful artistic style.
