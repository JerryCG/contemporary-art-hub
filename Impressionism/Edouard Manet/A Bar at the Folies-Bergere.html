        <i>A Bar at the Folies-Bergere</i> depicts a scene in the Folies Bergere nightclub in Paris. This time, the Paris Salon eventually
        accepted this painting and exhibited it in 1882. This work was considered Manet's last major work. However, at this time, Manet was
        seriously ill. He sighed with sadness, 'This should have brought me happiness, but it is too late now. This mistake lasted for 20 years.'

        This painting combines the noble temperament of Classicism and the gorgeous colors of Impressionism. Manet recorded the busy scene of the
        bar at midnight in an objective and calm perspective. The dark dress and white skin of the waitress forms a sharp color contrast. The most
        excellent part of this painting is the large mirror behind the waitress. The mirror subtly recorded the noisy, busy, dazzling and colorful world
        in front of the waitress. The bar flashes under the big crystal light. The vague figures are dancing on the floor.
