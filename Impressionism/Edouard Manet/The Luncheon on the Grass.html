         <i>The Luncheon on the Grass</i> depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather
        on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863,
        Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refuses,
        where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.

        Manet referred to the works of classicism artists, but depicted the
        serene rural scenes in a brand-new <u>naturalist</u> approach. He
        replaced the perfect figures like Goddess and Virgin with ordinary
        people in daily lives. Also, the background was no longer devine but
        replaced with common views in the real world.
        This irritaed the Art Conservatives and critisized
        that it was absolutely shameless work.

        However, Manet's innovative idea reflected in this painting quickly
        won the respect from young artists. "To record the visual reality"
        became the core proposition that impressionists puesued.
