        Manet visited the Grand Canal Venice in September 1875 with his
        friend and fellow painter from outside the Impressionist circle
        James Tissot, who had settled in London after the Franco-Prussian
        war of 1870-71. Although the watery splendour of Venice has inspired
        many great artists, Manet found it hard to settle, but in spite of
        this he managed to paint one of his most dashingly Impressionist art works.

    <p>No matter in the aspect of view setting or color using, <i>the grand canal of Venice</i> is
    the most standard masterpiece of Impressionism. The dotted, lining and colorful brush strokes
    creates a vivid feeling that sunlight is flashing and beating over the water. The helmsman on the boat is depicted via sketch. Houses far away are blurred up.
    This painting uses vivid and casual colors to record the floating and flowing
    riverside scene bathing in the sunlight. </p>
