    <p><i>Impression, Sunrise</i> depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise,
    the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red Sun being the focal elements.
    In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on
    the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts.
    Behind them are other misty shapes that are not trees but smoke stacks of packboats
    and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys
    silhouetted against the sky. In order to show these features of industry,
    Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty,
    leaving the background unobscured.</p>

        The painting is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement. It uses
        relaxing and bouncing brush strokes, bright and rich colors, to depict a foggy morning of
        a port city. In a dim hue, the vivid rising sun sprinkles a ray of sunlight onto the sea surface.
        Small boats nearby and houses far away are looming under Monet's bold strokes. Monet stored
        the momentary impression of the sunrise scene onto the canvas, making the still picture flash
        rays of light.
