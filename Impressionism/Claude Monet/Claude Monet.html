    <p>
        A French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and
        the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's
        philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature,
        especially as applied to plein air landscape painting.
        The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting
        <a href="Impression, Sunrise.html" target="_blank">Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Monet is the most exceptional Impressionism artist. He is called "Father of Impressionism".
        Monet is an expert at drawing water. During his childhood, he lived in a seaside town and was
        obsessed by water in his nature. Most of his works depict the water scene. People called
        him as "Raphael on the water". Monet's great achievements are fully and particularly shown
        in his series paintings. 
    </p>
    <p>Monet's art put emphasis on the momentary changes of light and colors. He once said, 'I desire to
    express my feelings and impressions before the light effect that is easiest to fade away disappears.'</p>
