    <h1 class="heading"><u>Houses of Parliament series</u> <sub>(Claude Monet, Impressionism)</sub></h1>
    <p>Claude Monet painted a series of oil paintings of the Houses of Parliament (also known as the Westminster Palace)
    , home of the British Parliament,
    in the fall of 1899 and the early months of 1900 and 1901 during stays in London.
    All of the series' paintings share the same viewpoint from Monet's window or a terrace
    at St Thomas' Hospital overlooking the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
        In previous Series paintings, <a href="Rouen Cathedral series.html" target="_blank"><i>Rouen Cathedral</i></a>,
        Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects.
        While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted
        and obscured by the fog and smog that it becomes secondary as the subject.
        For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on
        objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself.
