    <h1 class="heading1">Impressionism</h1>
    <p><b><i>Impressionism</i></b> is a <u>19th-century art movement</u> characterized
    by small, thin brush strokes, 
    emphasis on accurate depiction of light,
    ordinary subject matter and inclusion of movement.
    </p>
    <p>Impressionsim is a "sunlight revolution" on the canvas. Impressionism
    artists present us a colorful world bathing in the sunlight, which is
    different from the tan and brown style of classical arts. Paris impressionism
    is an art genre originated in the cafes, where impressionists communicate,
    create and grow.</p>
    <p>Different from the concept of "Inherent Color of Objects" in traditional arts,
    impressionists claim the color of objects will change if the light source
    changes, which is supported by the 19th century's physical discovery. They
    try to capture the instant changes of light and colors. Impressionism is
    the concentrated reflection of Naturalism.</p>
