    <p><b><i>Contemporary Art</i></b> (Western) is a collective term that includes various art genres
    and art concepts happening in the European countries, the USA, especially in Paris (France)
    from the late 19th century to the middle/late of 20th century till now.</p>
    <p>On the whole, contemporary art is an extremely complicated and unpredictable
    art phenomenon. No matter the forms of arts or the spirits hidden in arts,
    western contemporary art goes beyond the asthetic category of western traditional
    art. It builds up a new system of diversified modern visual views and cultural
    traditions. </p>
    <p><i>This website is designed to help people who are interested in contemporay
    art learn about it in an eaiser and more relaxing manner. </i></p>
