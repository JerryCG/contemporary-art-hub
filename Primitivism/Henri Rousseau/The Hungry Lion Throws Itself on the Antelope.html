        <i><b>The Hungry Lion Throws itself on the Antelope</b></i> was the second jungle scene Rousseau painted after his return to painting the flora and fauna of the jungle,
        which was based off of the diorama of stuffed animals in the Paris Natural History Museum. Upon its exhibition, it was derided by its critics, who were shocked at its
        display alongside establishment paintings and Renaissance sculptures. Works such as this continued to be ridiculed by his critics until his death in 1910, by he was
        lauded by his contemporary independent artists, such as Matisse, Picasso, and Toulouse-Lautrec.
