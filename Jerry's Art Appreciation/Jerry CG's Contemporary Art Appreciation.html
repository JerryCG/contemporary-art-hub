    <h2 class="heading2">Appreciation of the Atlas 3 Concert</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">At the very beginning of the concert, the sudden loud knock of a court
hammer really frightened me. And the following knocks were as heavy as the
first one, which created a serious and solemn atmosphere. The style of the
musical composition was mysterious and thrilling. In my opinion, the notes and
melodies were kind of broken and conflicted, thus making people attentive to
the whole performance without distraction. I think this concert depicted a vivid
picture of the city night. I heard the sounds of chilly wind from the flute and
some tragic birds' sounds from the clarinet. Strong comparison of loud and light
sounds, intense combination of high and low notes were typical of this amazing
performance. The inharmonious tune told a story of black humor, which seemed
to be irrational and radical and made me think of Dadaism. All the 5 musicians
all performed with serious facial expressions and full concentration until the very
end of the concert.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph">
        The most important feature of this concert was that musicians walked away
from the court one by one. They actually didn't simply disappear; rather, they
walked into a prison-like room (actually once a prison) and continued to
perform the composition. And we could clearly see what was exactly going on in
that room through the screen hanging at the front. At the end, only one
musician remained in the original court. Even the melody had stopped, the
performance didn't come to an end. There was a long period of silence, which
was like a silent accusation of the modern machinery world.
