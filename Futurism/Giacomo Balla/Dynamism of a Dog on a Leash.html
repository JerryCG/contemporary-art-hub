        <i><b>Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash</b></i> depicts a dachshund on a leash and the feet of a lady walking it,
        both in rapid motion as indicated by the blurring and multiplication of their parts.
        Balla's interest in capturing a single moment in a series of planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Balla painted this amusing study of a skittering dachshund and the staccato steps of his or her owner in May 1912 while visiting one of his students,
        the Contessa Nerazzini, at Montepulciano, near Siena. The lively background, with its vibrating and contrasting streaks of pink and green, is said to
        represent the white dust of the Tuscan countryside shimmering under the bright summer sun. The feet of the woman, the leash, and the dog's body from nose
        to tail are all blurred and repeated. To enhance the impression of speed, Balla painted the ground using diagonal lines and placed his signature and the
        date at a dynamic angle. This rhythmic gesture also extends to the frame, which both contains and continues the composition.
