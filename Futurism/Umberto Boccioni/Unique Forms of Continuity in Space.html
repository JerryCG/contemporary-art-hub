        Emerging from the need for breaking off with the past, Italian Futurism was a celebration of technology, power, and modern life. The sculpture <i><b>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space</b></i> created in 1913 by Umberto Boccioni
        is now regarded a masterpiece and an icon of the movement.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This sculpture was one of Boccioni's few cast pieces however, he skillfully executes the essence of the futurist movement. The unknown figure strides through space almost appearing in a superhuman fashion.
        Bonded to the base, Boccioni created movement in the sculpture by attaching wing like extensions from the body. The bronze casting has a heavy quality however, the flame like style of the sculpture also has a lightness as well.
        This juxtaposition makes the sculpture interesting and ever-changing. The shapes and angles of the sculpture change as one circles the figure. Each perspective is different, making the figure more ambiguous. This sculpture perfectly embodies
        the Futurist movement because of it's strength and fast pace quality.
