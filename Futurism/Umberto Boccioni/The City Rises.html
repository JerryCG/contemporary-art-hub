        <i><b>The City Rises</b></i> is considered by many to be the very first truly Futurist painting.
        Boccioni took a year to complete it and it was exhibited throughout Europe shortly after it was finished.
        It testifies to the hold that Neo-impressionism and Symbolism maintained on the movement's artists even after Futurism was inaugurated in 1909.
        It was not until around 1911 that Boccioni adapted elements of Cubism to create a distinct Futurist style.

        Nevertheless, The City Rises does capture the group's love of dynamism and their fondness for the modern city.
        A large horse races into the foreground while several workers struggle to gain control of it, suggesting a primeval conflict between humanity and beasts.
        The horse and figures are blurred, communicating rapid movement while other elements, such as the buildings in the background, are rendered more realistically.
        At the same time, the perspective teeters dramatically in different sections of the painting.
