        Painted in the Futurist style, <i><b>The Street Enters the House</b></i> centres on a woman on a balcony in front of a busy street,
        with the sounds of the activity below portrayed as a riot of shapes and colours.

        The central figure of The Street Enters the House is a woman dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above.
        She looks over her balcony at a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On the road in front of her,
        workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, surrounded by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction,
        white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road.
        A line of horses flies past the foreground.

        The painting in general showcases Boccioni's evolution from a Neoimpressionist style to one more aligned with the ideals of Cubism,
        and the catalog description for the piece demonstrates his increasing fascination with scientific terminology.
        It includes lines such as "The principles of Roentgen rays is applied to the work, allowing the personages to be studied from all sides,
        objects both at the front and the back are in the painter's memory."
