        The futurism masterpiece <i><b>Materia</b></i> is a full-length portrait of the artist's mother,
        the main subject of numerous canvases made by him, as in the case of the mother with the crochet of 1907.
        The mother in the painting is portrayed sitting in her house frontally, so as to turn your back on a balcony overlooking the urban landscape behind.
        This compositional choice serves to merge into a single "simultaneous vision" the optical perception of two very distinct subjects,
        the metropolitan environment and the artist's mother.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The hands of the maternal figure are represented crossed and gigantic and form the focus of the portrait.
        The urban scenario appears as a space perfectly integrated with the human figure, the profiles of the houses
        are represented as nuclei generating large beams of transparent blue light, that illuminate the "mother" from above.
        Typical of this picture is the energy that is formed thanks to the colors used, an energy that goes in every direction
        as it is typical of the current of belonging, the Futurism.
