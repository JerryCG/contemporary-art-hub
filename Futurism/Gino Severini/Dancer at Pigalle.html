        The dancer, depicted in the middle of <i><b>Dancer at Pigalle</b></i> is composed of a dynamic intersection of lines and swirling fabric, which typically shows the features of futurism. Four beams of stage lighting focus inwards on her,
        highlighting her as the center of the image whilst, in contrast, her rapid, rotational movements radiate out in concentric circles to the edges of the pictorial plane. Each of these circular
        layers contains fragmentary images of musicians, instruments, viewers, and shapes evoking musical notes, capturing an essence of the space in which she performs.
