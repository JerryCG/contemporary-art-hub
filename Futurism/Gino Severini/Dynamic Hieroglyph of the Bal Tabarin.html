        Gino Severini's <i><b>Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin</b></i> draws us into the frenzied excitement of a Paris nightclub.
        Combining a Cubist technique of fractured planes with the use of repetition, Severini creates a brilliant kaleidoscope of partially-glimpsed figures in motion.
        Dominating the center of the painting are two dancing women - one with blond curls on the left, the other with dark hair on the right - and a swirling pink and purple dress.
        Looping patterns of real sequins decorate the dress, adding to the shimmering play of light in the painting.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Severini conveys the dancer's movements through the repetition and fragmentation of forms. For example, we see parts of the head of the dancer on the left in three or four different positions as she dances.
        The swirling movements of the dancer's skirts are depicted as fragments of patterned purple, pink, light blue, and white material appearing in various locations. In addition, abstract curves and angles suggest the changing
        shapes of the fabric as the dancer moves through space. A bright circle of white dominates the center of the painting, suggesting a spot-lit dance floor and the swirling circular movements of the dancers.
