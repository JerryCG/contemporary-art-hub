        <i><b>White on White</b></i> is one of the most well-known examples of the Russian Suprematism movement, painted the year after the October Revolution.

Part of a series of "white on white" works begun by Malevich in 1916, the work depicts a white square, portrayed off-centre and at an angle on a ground which is also a white square of a slightly warmer tone.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        White on White depicts the off white square, positioned at a slight angle, that has been placed onto a white background that appears to be warmer and more dense in colour.
        What Malevich has been able to do is to or present two white squares, in completely different ways. What is uniquely clever is that the second square has not been painted at all,
        but is simply the square canvas.
