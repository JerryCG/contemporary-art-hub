         The language of <i><b>Suprematist Composition</b></i> consists of paint, surface, geometric shapes and primary colors.
         It communicates that there's something more pure, more universal and truer than the images of the natural world.
         As Malevich's written manifesto says, "I have destroyed the ring of the horizon...To reproduce beloved objects and little
         corners of nature is just like a thief being enraptured by his legs in irons. Things have disappeared like smoke;
         to gain the new artistic culture, art approaches creation as an end in itself and domination over the forms of nature."
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When we decipher the language of this painting and understand its statements, we connect with universalities rather than specifics.
        We comprehend the concepts of space, movement, form, togetherness, isolation and relativity. We notice similarities and differences
        but that there is no hierarchy of importance between the aesthetic elements. We see shapes stripped of their symbolism.
        We see a composition that's open to introspective interpretation rather than being burdened by objective meaning.
