        <i><b>Proun 99</b></i> is a Suprematist tempera painting created by El Lissitzky from 1923 to 1925.
        Lissitzky's Prounen or Proun work, which spanned a variety of media from painting and illustration to physical installation,
        was the artist's effort to create three-dimensional environments in which two-dimensional shapes could exist in direct contrast
        to the space they inhabited. The end result for Lissitzky was ideally to create an ongoing tension between open, negative,
        three-dimensional space and flat, purely abstract, geometric forms. Painting and drawing, which had formerly existed independently
        of the three-dimensional media of sculpture and architecture, could now be fused to them to create new, integrated forms -
        ideally, the futuristic, Suprematist-style buildings Lissitzky envisioned.
