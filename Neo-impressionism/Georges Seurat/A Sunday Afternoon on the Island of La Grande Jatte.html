    <p><i>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</i> is made up of
    around 3.5 million pure color points. These dots of different colors line up together, creating a more vivid and colorful visual effect
    compared with mixing paint. If we look at the painting from a distance, these color dots will become vague, giving viewers a sense of harmony and unity.
    If we take a closer look, all we can see are pure color dots lining up tightly. </p>
    
    <p>This painting is the most excellent and influential artwork of Seurat.
    He spent two years drawing this painting. It is just like an amazing chemical experiment
    of colorful dots on canvas. The picture depicts that in a sunday afternoon, people
    are having vacation on the island of La Grande Jatte by the Seine. Early summer's
    bright sunlight, fresh green lawns, crowded people form an asthetic feeling of
    harmony and serenity. No line exists in this painting. It is purely
    formed by countless contrasting pure color dots. Small and elegant brush strokes
    create a bright and rich world. Lining dots have a mysterious airy sense. </p>
