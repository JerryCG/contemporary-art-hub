    <p>This painting, the third of Seurat's six major works,
    is a response to critics who criticized Seurat's technique
    for being cold and unable to represent life.
    Thus, the artist offers a nude, the same model, in three
    different poses. In the left background is part of Seurat's
    1884 to 1886 painting <a href="A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.html" target="_blank"><i>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of
    La Grande Jatte</i></a>.

        The model bodies are completely made up of pure color dots without any lines.
        However, the volume and perspective sense of the figures still stands out.
        When drawing the skin, pure color dots do not mess up the picture but create a
        harmonious sense of skin color. <i>Baudelaire</i> gave an explanation to this phenomenon, "
        It is just like a high-speed spinning top. The top looks grey, but it contains all the colors actually."
