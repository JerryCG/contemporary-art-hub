       By the time Signac created this work, he was no longer
       enthusiastic about Pointillism, having developed his own
       style. He had passed a number of stages: through
       Impressionism, he arrived at Georges Seurat's
       Neo-impressionism - only to reject it later and give
       free reign to his talent of a tender colorist.
       Tenderness of color - that is the term, though informal,
       that applies to Signac's landscapes of his late period.

        He, in a way, mingled the two styles - Impressionisms
        and Pointillism. Instead of dots, he used large, differently
        directed brushstrokes of pure color. This technique helped
        him achieve a miraculous effect: you can almost see the
        clouds float and hear the leaves whisper. Unlike traditional
        Pointillist works, Signac's late pictures never give an
        impression of time standing still, which is typical of
        dotted images. How can one believe that there is no more
        time when one can watch the clouds moving in the sky and
        the trees glittering?
