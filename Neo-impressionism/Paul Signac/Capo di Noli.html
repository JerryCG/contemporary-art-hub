        In <b><i>Capo di Noli</i></b>, Signac created a balanced composition of lines and colours.
        The effect of his depiction had been worked out with great care in the studio and
        precisely calculated before he implemented his ideas on canvas.
        The world of things was now only an excuse for the mise-en-scene of colour,
        and this view of the cliffs of the Mediterranean coast is no exception:
        the colour texture is what matters here, not, as with the Impressionists,
        the 'impression' of a natural scene. Precisely this non-natural application
        of pure colour was what had a lasting influence on painters in the early
        twentieth century - both the Fauves in France, and the Expressionists in Germany.
